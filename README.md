## 🧠 About Me

I’m a **MERN stack developer** with a strong foundation in building and deploying full-stack applications. I've delivered real-world solutions for clients and startups, both independently and as part of an agile team.

Over the past year, I’ve worked as a **development intern**, contributing to scalable, production-grade applications using **MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js**.

I bring a solid grasp of **cloud deployment (AWS)**, REST APIs, responsive UI design, and backend logic. I’m currently exploring **freelance opportunities and full-time roles** where I can ship value fast, iterate efficiently, and build tools that matter.
